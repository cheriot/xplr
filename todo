Prototype Questions
* Are these travel articles actually helpful?
  *** http://eatyourworld.com/
  * Use all from http://www.theexpeditioner.com/the-top-50-travel-blogs/

Design for each api method:
* render react markup
* actions, instead of requesting data, record in a global store the data needed
* on the client, make a bulk request
* on the server, trigger bulk request handler

Challenges:
* how to reach into Alt's state on the server?
* how to run something after all components have rendered?

quicker, easier, option:
* use a page component to handle/make the only data requst
* the server responds with the extended message format
* stores are populated and subsequent actions return data immediately

Challenges:
* how to get a store to check all requests from all requests?

Message format
{
  lists: {
    feeds: [ids],
    feed_entry_queue: [ids]
  },
  entities: {
    feeds: {id: entity},
    feed_entries: {id, entity}
  },
  associations: {
    feeds_feed_entries: {
      feed_id: [ids]
    }
  }
}

As needed
* do i need elastic for any of this?
* consolidate configuration with https://github.com/indexzero/nconf
* logging
* bookends for associations: http://city41.github.io/bookends/demo.html
