Steps
* view entries queue
  * actions
  * store
  * listen to feed deletions

for any url:
* render react markup
* actions, instead of requesting data, record in a global store the data needed
* on the client, make a bulk request
* on the server, trigger bulk request handler

Challenges:
* how to reach into Alt's state on the server?
* how to run something after all components have rendered?

quicker, easier, option:
* use a page component to handle/make the only data requst
* the server responds with the extended message format
* stores are populated and subsequent actions return data immediately

Challenges:
* how to get a store to check all requests from all requests?

Message format

  },
  associations: {
    feeds_feed_entries: {
      feed_id: [ids]
    }
  }
}

* label feed entries with city, district, country, lat, lon
* tag feed entries
* place autocomplete
* display feed entries for selected place
